# FLIDS
Federated Deep Learning-based Intrusion Detection System for IoT This project implements a federated deep learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to enhance IoT cybersecurity. The system leverages collaborative model training across multiple devices while maintaining data privacy, aiming to detect and mitigate cyber threats in real-time.
